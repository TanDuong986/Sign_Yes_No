# Yes_No_Sign
This is final project of Coursera course:  [**Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-computer-vision-watson-opencv)

The task is clasify the image that have stop sign or not.

This project build a simple Convolutional Neural Network. The dataset has approximate 100 samples for each class with various size, I had write a function to survey the size of all image, you can choose the size to train based on your need.

Although the amount of data is quite small, I gain the accuracy among 75-80%. I know it can higher, let contribute more for me if you have some fancy solving. I'm looking forward to hearing you ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°
